# Horiseon-project
## UCI-Bootcamp First Assignment
This is my first assignment for UCI coding bootcamp. This project helped me get familiar with HTML and CSS. I converted a lot of code into more semantic and easier to read code. The starter code was all over the place and out of order. It had a quite a bit of repeating code that I cleaned up and consolidated. I reordered the CSS code to be sequential and read in order with the HTML file. I added accessibility ALT attributes to all images. I learned how to convert [div] into semantic HTML code.
